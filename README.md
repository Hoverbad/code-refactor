A Refactor of the Horiseon website HTML

![Horiseon Webpage Screenshot](/Hoverbad/code-refactor/Horiseon.jpg?raw=true "Horiseon Screenshot")

The client requested that their website codebase be refactored to follow accessability standards so that it would be optimized for search engines. 

To complete the refactor I did the following:

    - Reorganized the CSS to align with the HTML 
    - Consolidated redundant CSS selectors
    - Added alt tags to the images to ensure accessability 
    - Added a Title element to the webpage 
    - Added semantic HTML to the codebase
